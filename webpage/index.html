    <ul>
        <li>How to play!</li>
        <li>Use the Left, Right, Up and Down Arrows to turn and then press again to move. So left to turn then left again to move. Unless you are facing that direction.</li>
        <li>Spacebar drops bombs! They don't hurt you but block your movement.</li>
        <li>The bombs destroy the greenish walls and kill enemies. They will destroy the wall before the bad guy. So place carefully.</li>
        <li>Find the portal to win or kill all the enemies.</li>
        <li>Getting touched by a bad guy will instantly kill you. Game over!</li>
        <li>No score, sorry.</li>
        <li>Or nice entry page for that matter.</li>
        <li>The tutorial can be skipped slightly. Just press spacebar after the title screen then enter after the bomb blows up. Then enter again. </li>
        <li>This is useful to quickly play again.</li>
